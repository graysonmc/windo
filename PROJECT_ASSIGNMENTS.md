# Project 1: Landing Page

## Overview

Create a minimal, clean landing page that will eventually serve as the entry point for new users. This page will be built directly into the existing web application.

### Timeline
- **Duration:** 1-2 days
- **Priority:** High
- **Complexity:** Low

### Technical Requirements

#### File Structure

Create the following files in the existing web app:

```
/apps/web/src/
  /pages/
    HomePage.jsx         (existing - don't modify)
    LandingPage.jsx     (create this)
  /components/
    /landing/           (create this folder)
      HeroSection.jsx   (optional - can all be in LandingPage.jsx)
```

#### Implementation

**LandingPage.jsx Structure:**
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { User } from 'lucide-react';

export default function LandingPage() {
  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-900">
      {/* Navigation Bar */}
      <nav className="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 border-b border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700">
        <div className="max-w-7xl mx-auto px-6 py-4">
          <div className="flex items-center justify-between">
            <div className="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400">

            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </nav>

      {/* Main Content */}
      <div className="max-w-4xl mx-auto px-6 py-20 text-center">
        <h1 className="text-5xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 mb-6">
          Transform Cases Into Simulations
        </h1>

        <p className="text-xl text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mb-12">
          AI-powered business simulations that adapt to every student
        </p>

        {/* Auth Buttons */}
        <div className="flex gap-4 justify-center">
          <button className="flex items-center gap-2 px-6 py-3 bg-white border border-gray-300 rounded-lg hover:bg-gray-50 transition-colors">
            <img src="/google-icon.svg" alt="Google" className="w-5 h-5" />
            Sign in with Google
          </button>

          <button className="px-6 py-3 bg-blue-600 text-white rounded-lg hover:bg-blue-700 transition-colors">
            Create Account
          </button>
        </div>

        {/* Beta Badge */}
        <div className="mt-12">
          <span className="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-100 text-blue-700 rounded-full text-sm font-medium">

          </span>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Integration Instructions

1. **Add to HomePage.jsx temporarily for testing:**
Add a simple link or button to access the landing page. At the top of the existing HomePage component, add:

```jsx
// Temporary: Remove this after testing
const [showLanding, setShowLanding] = useState(false);

if (showLanding) {
  return <LandingPage />;
}

// In the render, add a toggle button:
<button
  onClick={() => setShowLanding(true)}
  className="fixed bottom-4 right-4 px-4 py-2 bg-purple-600 text-white rounded-lg"
>
  View Landing Page
</button>
```

### Requirements

# Project 2: AI Setup Wizard

## Overview

Build an intelligent conversational interface that interviews professors to understand their teaching goals and automatically generates optimal simulation configurations. This should feel like having a knowledgeable colleague help you set up your simulation.

### Timeline
- **Duration:** 2-3 weeks
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Complexity:** High

### Core Concept

Instead of professors manually configuring 15+ settings, they have a natural conversation with an AI that asks smart questions and builds the perfect simulation setup. The system should be efficient - gathering the minimum information needed for a good experience without sacrificing quality.

### Technical Requirements

#### File Structure

```
/apps/web/src/
  /components/
    /SetupWizard/              (create this folder)
      SetupWizard.jsx          (main component)
      ChatInterface.jsx        (conversation UI)
      ConfigGenerator.jsx      (converts chat to config)
      WizardContext.jsx        (state management)
    /SimulationBuilder.jsx     (existing - study this for reference!)
```

#### Key Features to Implement

1. **Intelligent Conversation Flow**
   - Natural language understanding using OpenAI API
   - Adaptive questioning based on responses
   - Smart defaults to minimize questions
   - Context awareness from uploaded documents

2. **Document Integration**
   - Accept document uploads during conversation
   - Extract context to reduce questions needed
   - Use existing parser in SimulationBuilder.jsx as starting point
   - Improve or replace parsing logic as needed

3. **Configuration Mapping**
   - Access to ALL simulation settings
   - Discretion over which to configure vs use defaults
   - Output same config format as manual setup
   - Validate configuration before finalizing

#### Existing Resources to Leverage

**Study these existing files:**

1. **SimulationBuilder.jsx** - Contains:
   - Current setup form structure
   - Document upload and parsing logic
   - Configuration object format
   - Validation logic

2. **Example Configuration Output:**
```javascript
{
  name: "Simulation Name",
  scenario_text: "Full scenario description...",
  objectives: ["Critical Thinking", "Strategic Planning"],
  parameters: {
    duration: 45,
    complexity: "adaptive",
    ai_mode: "socratic_guide",
    time_pressure: "moderate",
    document_context: "uploaded_file_content..."
  }
}
```

3. **Existing Parser Example** (from SimulationBuilder.jsx):
```javascript
// The current system has a basic parser - you can improve this
const parseScenarioText = (text) => {
  // Extracts company, situation, objectives
  // You can enhance or replace this
};
```

### Implementation Guidelines

#### Design Philosophy

**Efficiency First:**
- Don't ask questions if the answer can be inferred
- Use document content to skip redundant questions
- Quick setup path for experienced users (3-4 questions)
- Detailed path for users who need guidance

**Example Efficient Flow:**
```
AI: "What's the main skill you want students to practice?"
Prof: "Negotiation" [uploads merger case document]

AI: [Reads document, extracts: 45-min duration, M&A context, two parties]
"I see this is a merger negotiation. Should students represent the buyer or seller?"
Prof: "Buyer"

AI: "Perfect! I've configured a 45-minute merger negotiation from the buyer's perspective. Ready to launch?"
[Already inferred all other settings from context]
```

#### Creative Freedom Areas

You have complete freedom to design:

1. **Conversation Style**
   - Formal vs friendly tone
   - Linear vs branching dialogue
   - Number and depth of questions

2. **UI/UX Design**
   - Chat bubble style vs form wizard
   - Progress indicators
   - Real-time config preview or reveal at end

3. **Intelligence Features**
   - When to ask follow-ups
   - How to handle ambiguous responses
   - Confidence scoring for generated configs
   - Learning from user corrections

4. **Technical Approach**
   - State management solution
   - API interaction patterns
   - Error handling strategy

### Minimum Requirements

1. **Functional Conversation:** Natural dialogue that feels intelligent
2. **Document Support:** Can upload and extract context from files
3. **Valid Output:** Generates proper simulation configuration
4. **Efficiency:** Minimizes questions while maintaining quality
5. **Error Handling:** Gracefully handles unclear inputs

### Deliverables

1. **Working Prototype**
   - Integrated into existing app
   - Accessible from SimulationBuilder
   - Fully functional conversation flow

2. **Documentation**
   - Flow chart of conversation logic
   - Explanation of design decisions
   - List of all settings it can configure

3. **Demo Materials**
   - Video showing 2-3 different user journeys
   - Examples of efficient vs detailed setups
   - How it handles edge cases

### Integration Points

The wizard should integrate with the existing system:

```jsx
// In SimulationBuilder.jsx, add option to use wizard
<button onClick={() => setShowWizard(true)}>
  Use AI Setup Assistant
</button>

{showWizard && (
  <SetupWizard
    onComplete={(config) => {
      // Receives same config object as manual setup
      setSimulationConfig(config);
      setShowWizard(false);
    }}
    onCancel={() => setShowWizard(false)}
  />
)}
```

### Evaluation Criteria

We're looking to see:
- How you approach conversation design
- User experience considerations
- Handling of edge cases and ambiguity
- Code quality and architecture decisions
- Creative problem-solving
- Balance between efficiency and thoroughness
